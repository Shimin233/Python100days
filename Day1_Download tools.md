Note that I use _italics_ to refer to applications/softwares in this article.

## Download Python
Check the current version of Python you have by typing 
```
python -V
```
in an application called _terminal_ on Mac OS.
If its reply is Python 2, then type the following code in _terminal_ 
```
python3 -V
```
If its reply is a version of Python 3 like "Python 3.8.4", then you have it prepared; if not, download as follows.

Download Python 3 (the lastest version is 3.8.4 on July 20 2020) from [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
Together with Python, its default shell _IDLE_ will be downloaded automatically; the shell is the place where you type codes.

## Download Sublime Text
This is a tool to help you type codes beforehand, in a tidy way.

Download it from [Sublime Text website](https://www.sublimetext.com).

You can save your codes typed in _Sublime Text_ as txt. file, by simply clicking "save" in the menu of "file".
Other formats like .py file are to be explored.
