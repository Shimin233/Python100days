## Improve our game
There are some suggested improvemnt of the game we created during previous days, such as
- give hints for the wrong guesses, like it being larger or smaller than the correct one
- provide multiple chances for the players to guess
- the correct guess can be random
We shall introduce more techniques to be prepared for improving the game.

## Conditional branching条件分支
Recall the following operators

|Python Comparison Operators|      Description        |
|---------------------------| ------------------------|
| `>`                       | strictly larger than|
| `>=`                      | no smaller than|
| `<`                       | strictly smaller than|
| `<=`                      | no larger than|
| `==`                      | equals|
| `!=`                      | does not equal|

As we have seen before, `1<5` will be interpreted as `True`, and other comparison operators work similarly.

The conditional branching in Python is as follows:
```Python
if:   #note there is a colon":" , same for else
   #the operations in the case of True
else:
     #the operations in the case of False
```
