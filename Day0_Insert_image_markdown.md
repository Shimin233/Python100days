## How to insert an image to markdown file

The syntax is of the following format:
```
![Drag Racing](Dragster.jpg)
#where [] encloses the label of the image in this file, can be quoted for later use
# () encloses the name the image which are under the same directory as the markdown file lies, 
# or (/path/to/image.jpg), the path of image if it is not necessaily under the same directory
```

Try it:
![image0](Mills_Modern_Business_Penmanship_image0.jpg)
