## List
A list is a collection of integers, floats, strings and/or other items (like the planes in our second game); even lists can be the elements of another list. A list can be empty, too.

See the examples of a list.
```Python
>>> member=[

>>> mix=[1, 'me', 2.18, [1, 2, 3], 'right'] 
>>> empty=[]
```

To add elements to a list, we use `append()`.
```
>>> member.append('il')
>>> member

>>> len(member)
9
```
