I want to format maths like I did in LaTeX in my Python notes, which are markdown (.md) files. 

There are some related advice:\

[Someone's blog](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000019359797)(this talks about typing Math on Github as well as all the webs like segmentfault),\

Note that the above are mostly about typing LaTeX on __Github pages__ but not simply md files. Learn about Github pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).
