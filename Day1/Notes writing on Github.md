# Notes writing on Github

To start with, I am going to show how to write notes (or any article) using Github.

First, I create/rename my notes as "Notes writing on Github.md". Simply naming it as "blahblah.md" makes this file a .md file, where "md"=markdown (but " markdown" seems to mean using codes to format texts on Github, when I look for relating help on Github).
Then, type contents in the field of "Edit file". Here you can use special syntax and codes to format your texts.
As used in the beginning of this article, a __heading__ consists of one to six signs "#"+" "+ the contents.  For example, 
# the large title
## a smaller title
###### the smallest title
Note that the blank " " is necessary, otherwise it will show
#the large title
##a smaller title
######the smallest title

Other formatting tricks are explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
