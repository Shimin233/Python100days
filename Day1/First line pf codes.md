Open the _IDLE_, the shell of Python. You can see the first few lines are like
```
Python 3.8.4 (v3.8.4:dfa645a65e, Jul 13 2020, 10:45:06) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>>
```
The set of signs ">>>" means Python has been prepared for you to type more codes.
 
Now type `print('hello world')`right after `>>>`, so you will have
```
>>> print('hello world')
```
Press "Return"/"Enter" button, and you will get a response from Python, which is printing a line of text and a new ">>>" is provided. 
```
>>> print('hello world')
hello world
>>>
```
You can type more codes right after the newly prvided ">>>". I will omit ">>>" in the following texts, except for complete presentation of my codes.
